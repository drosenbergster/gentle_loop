### 1. Person-Centered Communication
Effective communication is the foundation of dementia care and helps reduce stress for both parties.
*   **Establish a Positive Mood:** Body language and attitude communicate more than words; use facial expressions and touch to convey affection.
*   **Get Attention First:** Minimize background noise like TVs or radios before speaking. Address the person by name and maintain eye contact at their level.
*   **Keep it Simple:** Use short sentences with simple words. Pitch your voice lower rather than raising it.
*   **Ask One Question at a Time:** Use yes/no questions and show physical choices (e.g., holding up two different shirts).
*   **Avoid Arguments:** Do not try to convince the person they are wrong or corrected their confused reality. Focus on the **feelings underlying their words**.

### 2. Behavioral Management (Agitation)
Agitation is a range of behaviors—restlessness, verbal aggression, and physical aggression—often triggered by medical issues, pain, or environmental stress.
*   **Identify Triggers:** Behavioral changes may result from **unmet needs**, such as hunger, thirst, or the need to leave a stressful situation.
*   **Physical Checks:** Always screen for underlying pain, infections (like UTIs), or medication side effects when behavior fluctuates suddenly.
*   **Distract and Redirect:** When agitation occurs, connect with the person's feelings first, then change the subject or environment (e.g., "I see you're sad, let's go for a walk").
*   **Structured Care Protocols:** Personal care like bathing or mouth care often triggers distress; using person-centered protocols can reduce fear and resistance.

### 3. Therapeutic Interventions and Activities
Meaningful activities are essential to preserve remaining skills and slow decline.
*   **The Montessori Approach:** Focus on roles and routines that make the person feel **useful and needed**. Use repetition and break tasks into simple, failure-free steps.
*   **Reminiscence Therapy:** Use "memory triggers" like old photos, music, and familiar scents to reinforce identity and improve mood.
*   **Music and Art:** Music can reduce agitation and provide a way to connect even after verbal skills fade. Art provides a sense of accomplishment and self-expression.
*   **Sensory Practices:** Tools like **aromatherapy** (lavender/lemon balm) and **massage** can induce calm and regulate the autonomic nervous system.
*   **Digital Tools:** Virtual Reality (VR) can stimulate cognition and provide social links, while social robots (like PARO) can act as facilitators for interaction and pain distraction.

### 4. Nutrition, Hydration, and Daily Care
As dementia progresses, routine tasks like eating and bathing require more support.
*   **"Food First" Approach:** Increase calories by adding high-protein/high-energy ingredients (butter, cream, cheese) to small portions rather than increasing meal size.
*   **Mealtime Success:** Use contrasting, plain-colored plates to help the person differentiate food. Offer **finger foods** to maintain independence for those struggling with cutlery.
*   **Hydration:** Aim for 6-8 glasses of fluid daily. Offer foods with high water content like melon or cucumber if drinking is refused.
*   **Bathing and Grooming:** Schedule these tasks for the person's "best time" of day. Use a hand-held showerhead and keep the person covered with a towel to reduce feelings of exposure.

### 5. Safety and Environmental Design
A well-designed environment acts as a silent tool to support orientation and safety.
*   **Reduce Unhelpful Stimulation:** Cover mirrors if they cause confusion and remove clutter to prevent falls.
*   **Optimize Helpful Stimulation:** Use clear signage for the "Bathroom" or "Kitchen" and ensure lighting is even and bright (minimum 300 lux).
*   **Wandering Prevention:** Use GPS tracking systems and ensure the person wears a medical ID bracelet.
*   **Home Modifications:** Mark step edges with bright tape and set water heaters to 120°F to prevent burns.

### 6. Administrative and Future Planning
Early planning is critical to ensure the person's medical and financial wishes are honored.
*   **Legal Documents:** Secure Durable Power of Attorney for both finances and healthcare, a Living Will, and a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) form.
*   **Financial Safeguards:** Set up automated bill payments and place the person on the National Do Not Call Registry to prevent fraud.
*   **Long-Term Care Evaluation:** When visiting facilities, observe staff-to-resident interaction, cleanliness, and whether residents appear well-cared for.

### 7. Caregiver Resilience
Caregivers must prioritize their own health to provide the best care.
*   **Self-Care Mantras:** Remind yourself: "I'm doing the best I can" and "I can't control everything".
*   **Support Networks:** Join support groups and utilize respite care (adult day centers or home health aides) to take necessary breaks.
*   **Professional Help:** Don’t hesitate to consult social workers or mental health professionals to process feelings of grief, guilt, or exhaustion.
