# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Fam
**Date:** 2026-02-04

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Dementia Caregiver App - MVP for Stress Reduction & Support
**Goals:** Define a usable, functional MVP for family/caregivers to smooth stressful moments and provide tracking/guidance.

### Context Guidance

_Loaded context from dementia_engagement_app_summary.md and person_centered_dementia_care.md._
_Key Strategy:_ "Reduced stress, not performance."
_Target Users:_ "The Doer" (hands-on care) and Family Circle.
_Core Philosophy:_ Person-Centered Care (Kitwood), Validation Therapy, and Caregiver Resilience.

## Idea Organization and Prioritization

### Theme 1: The Caregiver Anchor (Resilience & Self-Care)
_Focus: Tools specifically for the "Doer" (Mom/Aunt) to maintain their own regulation before attempting to regulate the person with dementia._

*   **The Anchor Screen:** A splash screen that forces a "Moment of Pause."
    *   _Content:_ Rotating high-resonance asset (Photo of Mom smiling, audio note from family).
    *   _Mantra:_ "I am doing the best I can" / "Connect with the fear, not the anger."
    *   _Novelty:_ Most apps dump you into a dashboard. This app prioritizes the caregiver's nervous system first.
*   **The "Venting" Button (Walkie-Talkie):**
    *   _Concept:_ A press-and-hold button to speak freely ("She's refusing to eat!").
    *   _Function:_ AI extracts the "Unmet Need" (Hunger) and the "Caregiver Emotion" (Frustration) to provide targeted support.
    *   _Constraint Solved:_ "Dirty Hands/Busy Hands" - no typing required.

### Theme 2: The Validation Bridge (BPSD Management)
_Focus: Moving from "Managing Behavior" to "Meeting Needs" using clinical best practices (DICE/DATE)._

*   **The Connection Prompt (vs. Task Prompt):**
    *   _Concept:_ Instead of "Do this," the app asks "How does she feel?"
    *   _Flow:_ Caregiver logs "Agitated" -> App prompts "Is she in pain? Thirsty?" (Source: *Physical Checks*) -> Suggests "Comfort Menu."
*   **The "Nudge" Card:**
    *   _Concept:_ Context-aware suggestions based on time/behavior.
    *   _Examples:_
        *   *Sundown:* "Try the 1950s Playlist."
        *   *Lunch:* "Remember the contrast plate."
        *   *Agitation:* "Validate the feeling: 'You seem worried'."

### Theme 3: The Family Hearth (Social & Emotional Support)
_Focus: Transforming the "Medical Handoff" into "Shared Care."_

*   **The Goodnight Capsule:**
    *   _Concept:_ Capturing "Wins" instead of medical stats. "What was the best moment today?"
    *   _Result:_ A "Highlight Reel" of Mom's remaining selfhood (Source: *Identity Preservation*).
*   **Morning Sticky Note:**
    *   _Concept:_ Family sends messages ("Thinking of you!") that appear as "Sticky Notes" on the dashboard.
    *   _Novelty:_ Asynchronous support that demands no reply from the stressed caregiver.

### Theme 4: The "Digital Whiteboard" (Cognitive Prosthetic)
_Focus: Reducing repetitive questioning and increasing orientation._
*   **Cast to Tablet Mode:** Turns an idle iPad into a high-contrast, static sign.
*   **Content:** "Today is Tuesday. Mary is coming at 2:00."
*   **Why:** Addresses the "When are we going?" loop directly.

## Prioritization Results: The MVP Action Plan

### Priority 1: The "Anchor Loop" (Immediate Stress Relief)
**Why:** This directly addresses the user's primary goal of "smoothing stressful moments" and providing "guidance."
1.  **Splash Screen:** "Breathe & Remember" (Image/Mantra).
2.  **Input:** "How is the moment?" (Voice or 3-Icon Tap).
3.  **Output:** Immediate, bite-sized strategy (e.g., "Food First," "Distract & Redirect").

### Priority 2: The "Context" Database (Expert Guidance)
**Why:** Leverages the rich clinical knowledge from *caregiving_tools_strategies_dementia.md*.
1.  **Integration:** Hard-code the strategies (Validation, Sensory, Environment) into the AI's response logic.
2.  **Curated Hacks:**
    *   *Sundowning:* "Give her a job (folding)." "Warm towel (Sensory)."
    *   *Refusal:* "Show choices visually." "Bridge with music."
    *   *Agitation:* "Check shoes/pain." "Validate the emotion."

### Priority 3: The "Love Layer" (Family Connection)
**Why:** Sustains the caregiver (Resilience).
1.  **Simple Messaging:** A "Send Love" feature for family that posts to the Caregiver's view.
2.  **Win Log:** A daily "One Good Thing" entry.

## Session Summary and Insights

**Key Achievements:**
*   Successfully pivoted from a "Memory Testing" concept to a **"Caregiver Resilience"** platform.
*   Mapped clinical strategies (Montessori, Validation Therapy) to concrete UI features (The Nudge Card).
*   Designed "Zero-Friction" inputs (Voice/Icon) specifically for the "Doer" under stress.
*   Incorporated **Teepa Snow & Montessori** specific "hacks" into the suggestion engine.

**Facilitator Insight:**
The user's intuition to "avoid mundane tracking" was critical. By focusing on *emotional* tracking (Wins, Feelings, Affirmations), the app becomes a source of energy rather than a drain. The distinction between "Emergency Brake" and "Moment of Pause" defined the app's gentle, supportive tone.
