### When You're Running Low

| # | Validation | Title | Content |
|---|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Running on empty is exhausting. You're still showing up — that matters. | Feel your feet on the floor | Name 5 things you can see. 4 you can touch. 3 you can hear. This tells your body it's safe. |
| 2 | Low energy days are part of this. You're allowed to rest. | Say it out loud | "I'm doing the best I can. I can't control everything." Your brain believes what it hears you say. |
| 3 | Your body is carrying stress. Let's help it release. | Try this breath | In for 4. Out for 6. The longer exhale tells your body it's safe. Do it three times. |
| 4 | You don't have to fix this moment. Just be present in it. | Find a familiar scent | Coffee, a lotion you love, fresh air. Something that brings you back to yourself, even for a moment. |

### When You're Holding Steady

| # | Validation | Title | Content |
|---|------------|-------|---------|
| 5 | You're holding steady. That takes real strength. | Feelings before fixing | Try "I can see you're upset" before solving anything. Validation opens doors. Correction closes them. |
| 6 | Loops happen. You have more options than you think. | Change the scene | If they're stuck in a loop, move somewhere else. "Let's go look out the window." Movement breaks thought patterns. |
| 7 | Words can be hard for both of you right now. | Show instead of tell | Hold up the mug instead of saying "coffee." Point to the chair. Visuals often land when words don't. |
| 8 | Sudden changes usually have a reason. | Check the basics | Hungry? Thirsty? In pain? Need bathroom? Too hot or cold? Behavior is often trying to tell you something. |
| 9 | Small adjustments can shift everything. | Lower and slower | Speak slower and lower. Even well-meaning loud voices can increase stress. A calm, low tone signals safety. |
| 10 | Simplicity is a gift you can give right now. | One question at a time | "Are you cold?" works. "Do you want a sweater or blanket or should I turn up the heat?" overwhelms. |

### When You've Got This

| # | Validation | Title | Content |
|---|------------|-------|---------|
| 11 | You've got some capacity right now. That's a gift. | Set up the space | Good moment to reduce clutter, label things with words AND pictures. A calmer space means fewer hard moments. |
| 12 | Predictability is one of the most powerful things you can offer. | Same time, same way | Routines reduce anxiety. Write down what works and repeat it. The brain relaxes when it can predict what's coming. |
| 13 | What you're learning is valuable. Capture it. | Note what's working | What music helped? What phrase landed? What triggered the hard moment? Future you will thank present you. |
| 14 | Sustainability requires support. This isn't optional. | When did you last ask for help? | Even 2 hours away helps you show up better. Who could you reach out to today? |
| 15 | Connection doesn't require words. | Try a photo or song | Familiar music can shift the mood even when words don't land. The feeling remains when the memory doesn't. |
| 16 | Small preparations have outsized impact. | Set up tomorrow tonight | Lay out clothes. Prep breakfast. Small things now mean fewer decisions when you're tired. |
