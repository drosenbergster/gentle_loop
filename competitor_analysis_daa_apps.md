# Competitor Analysis & Best Practices from DAA (Dementia Action Alliance)

This document summarizes key features and best practices from existing apps recommended by the Dementia Action Alliance. These insights should inform the PRD to ensure we are leveraging proven mechanisms while maintaining our unique "Caregiver Resilience" focus.

## Key Competitors & Feature Sets

### 1. Memory Clock (Android)
*   **Core Promise:** Remote connection between care partner and person with dementia.
*   **Key Feature:** Remote Reminders. Care partner sends reminders directly to the user's phone.
*   **Best Practice:** "Voice Messages" and "Pictures" are used for reminders instead of just text.
    *   *Application for Us:* This validates our **"Anchor Screen"** strategy of using high-resonance assets (photos/voice) for communication.

### 2. MapHabit
*   **Core Promise:** Routine management through visual mapping.
*   **Key Feature:** "Step-by-step instructions" using visual maps to help users move through their day (dress, eat).
*   **Best Practice:** **Visual consistency** and breaking tasks into micro-steps.
    *   *Application for Us:* We can use this for our **"Nudge"** content—suggesting *visual* cues (e.g., "Lay out clothes in order") rather than verbal commands.

### 3. It's Done!
*   **Core Promise:** Task confirmation and anxiety reduction.
*   **Key Feature:** Categorized tasks with "Done" confirmation.
*   **Best Practice:** Reducing the cognitive load of "Did I do that?" for the *Caregiver*.
    *   *Application for Us:* This supports our **"Goodnight Capsule"**—logging "Wins" gives the same dopamine hit of "Done," but focused on emotional success rather than chore completion.

### 4. Google Calendar / AnyList
*   **Core Promise:** Shared family visibility.
*   **Key Feature:** Voice assistant integration ("Add milk").
*   **Best Practice:** **Voice-First Input**.
    *   *Application for Us:* Validates our **"Voice Venting"** feature. If general users need voice for groceries, stressed caregivers *definitely* need voice for emotional logging.

## Strategic Differentiation

While these apps focus on **Task Management** (Calendar, To-Do, Routines), **gentle_loop** focuses on **Emotional Regulation**.

*   **The Gap:** None of these apps explicitly address the *Caregiver's* nervous system or provide real-time BPSD (behavioral) strategies.
*   **Our Wedge:** We are not managing the *Schedule*; we are managing the *Stress*.

## Integration into MVP

1.  **From Memory Clock:** Adopt the "Photo/Voice" delivery mechanism for the Anchor Screen.
2.  **From MapHabit:** Use "Visual Steps" in our "Caregiver Hacks" database (e.g., "Show the mug," not "Say coffee").
3.  **From AnyList:** Ensure "Voice Input" is a primary, not secondary, interaction mode.
