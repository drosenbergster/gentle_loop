This updated summary integrates the comprehensive strategies, clinical evidence, and person-centered philosophies detailed across the sources.

### 1. The Person-Centered Care (PCC) Paradigm
**Person-centered care** is a holistic approach that moves away from a traditional medical model focused on deficits to one that **recognizes the individuality and enduring selfhood** of those living with dementia. 
*   **Core Psychological Needs:** Well-being depends on meeting five core needs: **comfort, attachment, inclusion, occupation, and identity**.
*   **Language Matters:** Use **"person-first" language** (e.g., "person living with dementia") rather than "demented person" or "patient" to reduce stigma and promote dignity. 
*   **Personalization:** Care should be "done with" the person, not "to" them, incorporating their **life story, preferences, and cultural background** into every intervention.

### 2. Managing Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms (BPSD)
BPSD—including **agitation, aggression, apathy, and sundowning**—affects up to 97% of individuals and is the primary cause of caregiver stress.
*   **First-Line Treatment:** **Non-pharmacological interventions** are the standard first-line response because psychotropic medications carry significant risks, including stroke and increased mortality. 
*   **Behavior as Communication:** Challenging behaviors are often functional expressions of **unmet needs**, such as pain, hunger, thirst, or environmental overstimulation.
*   **Clinical Algorithms:** The **DICE cycle** (Describe, Investigate, Create, Evaluate) and the **DATE algorithm** are recommended frameworks for identifying triggers and tailoring responses.

### 3. Non-Pharmacological Therapeutic Arsenal
A variety of evidenced-based practices can mitigate BPSD and enhance the quality of life:
*   **Sensory Practices:** **Aromatherapy** (lavender/lemon balm) for agitation, **Bright Light Therapy** for sleep-wake cycles, and **Multisensory Stimulation (Snoezelen)** for engagement.
*   **Psychosocial Therapies:** **Reminiscence therapy** uses memory triggers (photos, music) to reinforce identity, while **Validation therapy** acknowledges the person's internal reality rather than correcting misconceptions.
*   **Creative and Physical Activities:** **Music therapy** (personally meaningful songs) can reduce agitation in 67% of individuals. **Adapted Physical Activity** and **Tango therapy** promote neuroplasticity and improve balance.
*   **Montessori Approach:** Focuses on **re-discovering strengths** through failure-free, hands-on tasks that provide a sense of purpose.
*   **Innovative Tools:** **Animaloid social robots** (like PARO) and **Virtual/Augmented Reality** offer cognitive distraction and social facilitation for those with severe impairment.

### 4. Communication and Daily Care Strategies
*   **Communication Techniques:** Speak slowly in a calm, low pitch; use **short sentences and yes/no questions**; and maintain eye contact at eye level.
*   **Nutrition and Hydration:** A **"Food First" approach** adds high-protein/calorie ingredients to small portions. Using **finger foods** and **color-contrasting plates** supports independence.
*   **Personal Care:** **"Bathing without a battle"** involves using person-centered protocols, such as hand-held showers and keeping the person covered with a towel to reduce fear.

### 5. Environment and Safety
*   **Universal Design (UD):** Homes should be **equitable, intuitive, and safe**.
*   **Environmental Modifications:** Use **300 lux lighting** to reduce shadows, label doors with **words and pictures**, and remove confusing mirrors.
*   **Wandering Prevention:** Enroll in "Safe Return" programs, use **GPS tracking**, and place "stop" signs or disguises on exit doors.

### 6. Caregiver Resilience and Future Planning
*   **Self-Care Competency:** Caregivers must use mindfulness-based stress reduction, such as **deep breathing and grounding techniques**, to prevent burnout. 
*   **Support Networks:** The **GUIDE Model** (Medicare) and respite services are essential for long-term sustainability.
*   **Administrative Readiness:** Early planning should include **Durable Power of Attorney**, **Living Wills**, and **DNR forms** while the person can still participate.
