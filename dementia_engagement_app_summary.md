# Dementia Engagement App Brainstorm (Summary)

## Core Product Principle
Design for **reduced stress**, not performance.

The app should avoid:
- quizzes / testing memory
- “Do you remember?” prompts
- forcing names/dates
- correction loops

The app should encourage:
- comfort
- routine
- familiarity
- gentle sensory prompts
- small moments of success

---

## Additional App Concepts

### 1) Companion Mode (Ambient iPad Display)
An app that becomes a calming “room object”:
- rotating family photos
- gentle music
- periodic reassurance prompts (“You are safe”, “You are loved”)

**Why it works:** no decisions required.

---

### 2) Grandma Radio (Scheduled Family Voice Messages)
Family records short loving voice notes and schedules playback.
- “Hi Grandma, it’s David. I love you.”

**Why it works:** familiar voices can regulate emotion even without recognition.

---

### 3) Gentle Timeline (Storybook, Not a Quiz)
Curated life moments presented as:
- “Here’s a moment from your life.”
- “This was a happy chapter.”

**Why it works:** emotional nourishment without pressure.

---

### 4) Caregiver AI Helper (Micro-Moment Guidance)
Caregiver types what’s happening (“pacing, wants to go home”) → app provides:
- 3 scripts
- 3 calming activities
- 3 environmental adjustments
- body language reminders

**Why it works:** real-time support during stressful moments.

---

### 5) Shared Art (Simple Collaborative Drawing)
Finger painting / watercolor bloom visuals.
- no skill required
- saved as keepsakes

**Why it works:** nonverbal connection + creation.

---

### 6) Comfort Menu (Personalized Calming Routines)
Save “recipes” for emotional regulation:
- “If anxious after 4pm → tea + music + window”

**Why it works:** creates repeatable, shareable routines.

---

### 7) Safe Call Button (Dementia-Friendly Video Call)
One-tap calling with a simplified interface.

**Why it works:** reduces confusion, increases connection.

---

### 8) Praise Generator
Provides affirmations caregivers can use:
- “You’ve always made people feel welcome.”
- “You deserve peace.”

**Why it works:** caregivers often don’t know what to say.

## Key Refinement Questions (To Choose the Right MVP)

### A) Who is the primary user?
- Person with dementia?
- Caregiver?
- Whole family?

Most successful products likely target the **caregiver**.

---

### B) What is the moment of need?
When do users reach for the app?
Common pain moments:
- agitation / pacing
- repeating questions
- difficulty connecting during visits
- handoff between caregivers
- family disagreement on approach

---

### C) What does “success” mean?
Possible outcomes:
- fewer agitation episodes
- caregiver feels less helpless
- more meaningful visits
- improved family coordination

---

### D) How do we avoid shame?
Critical design question:
**How can the app guarantee the person with dementia never feels corrected, tested, or watched?**

---

### E) What are the top triggers?
Personalization opportunity:
- sundowning (late afternoon)
- loud TV / noise
- unfamiliar voices
- hunger/thirst
- overstimulation

---

### F) Branding decision
Should it be explicitly “dementia support” or disguised as:
- calm companionship
- family connection
- comfort routines

---

### G) Reduce friction for caregivers
Caregivers are overwhelmed. Consider:
- 1 prompt/day
- passive screensaver mode
- offline support
- voice-first experience

---

## High-Impact Feature Ideas

### “One Tap Help” Button
Instantly provides:
- 1 calming script
- 1 distraction activity
- 1 environment adjustment
- 1 breathing reminder

---

### Family Handoff Mode
Quick summary for the next caregiver:
- what worked today
- what didn’t work
- mood today
- meals/snacks
- music that helped
- what to avoid

---

### Grandma Comfort Profile (Personalization Core)
A simple profile containing:
- favorite foods
- favorite music era
- comforting phrases
- sensitive topics
- triggers and calming routines
- names most recognized

---

## Suggested Startup-Style MVP Framing Questions
To decide direction, answer:
1. What’s the hardest part of being with grandma right now?
2. What moments feel most successful?
3. What makes her anxious most often?
4. Who else is involved in her care?
5. Build for **visits** or for **daily caregiving**?

---

## Recommended Strong MVP Direction
**Caregiver-focused app** combining:
- Loop Helper scripts
- Conversation cards
- Comfort profile + routines

**Why:** immediately practical, emotionally safe, and fast to build.
